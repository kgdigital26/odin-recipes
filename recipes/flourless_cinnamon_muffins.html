<h2>Original recipe by Professor P, documented by her student</h2>
<h3>This recipe is a flourless cinnamon muffin perfect for the gluten-free people in your life!</h3>
<p>I first had this dessert when I was a teacher's assistant for my wonderful college professor, Professor P. She is a tremendous baker, cook, teacher, and person. It was through the opportunity of being her TA that we fostered a beautiful friendship, and I consider her an incredibly close person in my life. She is family, which means her family is my family! Prof.P's hubsand is gluten-free, thus Prof P. has become an expert baker in all things GF and graciously shared this recipe with me.</p>
<p>These muffins will fool you. Their texture and taste are addicting, so much so that it's not even on your mind to ask if they are gluten-free, because your first question usually is "can I have more?"</p>
