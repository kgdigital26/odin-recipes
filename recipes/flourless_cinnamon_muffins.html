<h2>original recipe by Professor P, documented by Karisma</h2>
<h3>This recipe is a flourless cinnamon muffin perfect for the gluten-free people in your life!</h3>
<p>I first had this dessert when I was a teacher's assistant for my wonderful college professor, Professor P. She is a tremendous baker, cook, teacher, and person. It was through the opportunity of being her TA that we fostered a beautiful friendship, and I consider her an incredibly close person in my life. She is family. Which means her family is my family! Cue Gus, Prof. P's husband. He is equally as amazing as Prof. P and also gluten-free, thus Prof P. has become an expert baker in all thing GF.</p>
<p>These muffins will fool you. Their texture and taste are addicting, so much so that it's not even on your mind to ask if they are gluten-free, because your first question usually is "can I have more?"</p>
